# project-sign_up_form
This project is to test my comprehension of form elements and capabilities.
I will be recreating a generic sign-up form as provided by The Odin Project, with my own personal styles applied.
By the end of this project, I will have displayed my abilities in creating front-end forms as well as solidified my knowledge of these elements.
